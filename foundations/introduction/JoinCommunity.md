## Formatting your questions
- Asking your questions in a readable format helps everyone debug them better. Here are some ways to go about that:

- If you’re having trouble on the command line, make sure to include both your input and the error message you’re getting.

- In the chat rooms, code can be displayed differently from normal sentences by using backticks (``), which can be found above the Tab key on US and UK keyboards. Backticks are not the same as single quotation marks (‘’), which are found to the left of the Enter key.

- For a single line of code: use one backtick before and after your code.

`Your Code`

- For multiple lines of code: use three backticks on a separate line above and below your code.

- You can also use code highlighting to add color to your multi-line code by specifying the language:

```js or javascript
