# Commit messages

1. When you are applying for jobs, employers will look through your projects on GitHub and they will look through your commit history. Having good commits as a novice developer will help you stand out.

2. Having a good commit message history will allow you (or other developers working on your code) to quickly see what changes were made and why. This is useful if a bug is found in the code that needs to be fixed!

3. Having a good commit message history will also be helpful if you come back to a project you were working on after stepping away from it for a while. You likely wonâ€™t remember your thought process and changes made when initially writing out the code.
