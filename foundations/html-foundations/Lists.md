# Lists

## Unorded lists

- If you want a list of items where the order doesn't matter, you can use an unordered list

- Created using <ul></ul>
- Then the list is created via <li></li>

## Orded lists

- The opposite, if you want an ordered list
- created using <ol></ol>
- Then the same, list is <li></li>
