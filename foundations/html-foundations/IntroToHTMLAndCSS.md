# Intro to HTML and CSS

## Intro
- HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything you see when you look at something on the internet
- HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of
- All texct, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML
- CSS is what adds style to those plain elements
- HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, give it color, changes font, and makes it more pleasing

- Careful calling them programming languages, they are only concerned with presenting information, not handling programatic logic
